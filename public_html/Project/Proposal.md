    - Changing username/email should properly check to see if it’s available before allowing the change
    - Any other fields should be properly validated
    - Allow password reset (only if the existing correct password is provided)
        - [ ]Hint: logic for the password check would be similar to login
	Milestone 2:
Pick a simple game to implement, anything that generates a score that’s more advanced than a simple random number generator (may build off of a sample from the site shared in class)
What game will you be doing?
[game]
Briefly describe it.
[describe]
Note: For this milestone the game doesn’t need to be complete, just have something basic or a placeholder that can generate a score when played.
The system will save the user’s score at the end of the game if the user is logged in
There should be a scores table (id, user_id, score, created)
Each received score is a new entry (scores will not be updated)
The user will be able to see their last 10 scores
Show on their profile page
Ordered by most recent
Create functions that output the following scoreboards (this will be used later)
Top 10 Weekly
Top 10 Monthly
Top 10 Lifetime
Scoreboards should show no more than 10 results; if there are no results a proper message should be displayed (i.e., “No [time period] scores to display”)
	Milestone 3:
Users will have points associated with their account.
Alter the User table to include points with a default of 0.
This field will not be incremented/decremented directly, you must use the PointsHistory table to calculate it and set it each time the points change
Points should show on their profile page
You may show points elsewhere as well if you wish
Create a PointsHistory table (id, user_id, point_change, reason, created)
Any new entry should update the user’s points value (do not update the User points column directly)
SUM the point_change for the user_id to get the total
Competitions table should have the following columns (id, name, created, duration, expires (now + duration), current_reward, starting_reward, join_fee, current_participants, min_participants, paid_out (boolean), min_score, first_place_per, second_place_per, third_place_per, cost_to_create, created, modified)
User will be able to create a competition
Competitions will start at 1 point (reward)
User sets a name for the competition
User determines % given for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners
Combination must be equal to 100% (no more, no less)
User determines if it’s free to join or the cost to join (min 0 for free)
User determines the duration of the competition (in days)
User can determine the minimum score to qualify (min 0)
User determines minimum participants for payout (min 3)
Show any user friendly error messages
Show user friendly confirmation message that competition was created
The cost to the creator of the competition will be (1 + starting reward value)
If they can’t afford it, the competition should not be created
If they can afford it, automatically add them to the competition
Each new participant causes the Reward value to increase by at least 1 or 50% of the joining fee rounded up
Have a page where the User can see active competitions (not expired)
For this milestone limit the output to a maximum of 10
Order the results by soonest to expire
Will need an association table CompetitionParticipants (id, comp_id, user_id, created)
Comp_id and user_id should be a composite unique key (user can only join a competition once)
User can join active competitions 
Creates an entry in CompetitionParticipants
Recalculate the Competitions.participants value based on the count of participants for this competition from the CompetitionParticipants table.
Update the Competitions.reward based on the # of participants and the appropriate math from the competition requirements above
Best to due this based on a simple equation via the initial Competition data and participants
Show proper error message if user is already registered
Show proper confirmation if user registered successfully
Create function that calculates competition winners
Get all expired and not paid_out competitions
For each competition
Check that the participant count against the minimum required
Get the top 3 winners
Pick 1 (strike out the option you won’t do; do not delete):
Option 1: Scores are calculated by the sum of the score from the Scores table where it was earned/created between Competition start and Competition expires timestamps
Option 2: Where the score was earned/created between when the user joined the competition and when the Competition expires
Calculate the payout (reward * place_percent)
Round up the value (it’s ok to pay out an extra point here and there)
Create entries for the Users in the PointsHistory table
Apply the new values (SUM) to their points column in the Users table after entry is added
Reason should be recorded as ‘competition’ (or something with more precise information)
Mark the competition as paid_out = true
	Milestone 4:
User can set their profile to be public or private (will need another column in Users table)
If public, hide email address from other users
User will be able to see their competition history
Limit to 10 results
Paginate anything after 10
If no results, show the appropriate message
User with the role of “admin” can edit a competition where paid_out = false
They can adjust any of the regular form values
If the competition was expired they can update the duration to include extra time
Add pagination to the Active Competitions view
Show 10 competitions per page
Paginate anything after 10
If no results, show the appropriate message
Anywhere a username is displayed should be a link to that user’s profile
This includes all scoreboards
If the profile is private you can have the page just display “this profile is private” upon access
Viewing an active or expired competition should show the top 10 scoreboard related to that competition
Game should be fully implemented/complete by this point
Game should tell the player if they’re not logged in that their score will not be recorded.
User’s score history will include pagination
Show latest 10
Paginate after 10
Show appropriate message for no results
Home page will have a weekly, monthly, and lifetime scoreboard
Will also have a link to the game
Scoreboards will show username and points for the session
(See requirement about username linking to profile)

### Intructions
#### Don't delete this
1. Pick one project type
2. Create a proposal.md file in the root of your project directory of your GitHub repository
3. Copy the contents of the Google Doc into this readme file
4. Convert the list items to markdown checkboxes (apply any other markdown for organizational purposes)
5. Create a new Project Board on GitHub
   - Choose the Automated Kanban Board Template
   - For each major line item (or sub line item if applicable) create a GitHub issue
   - The title should be the line item text
   - The first comment should be the acceptance criteria (i.e., what you need to accomplish for it to be "complete")
   - Leave these in "to do" status until you start working on them
   - Assign each issue to your Project Board (the right-side panel)
   - Assign each issue to yourself (the right-side panel)
6. As you work
  1. As you work on features, create separate branches for the code in the style of Feature-ShortDescription (using the Milestone branch as the source)
  2. Add, commit, push the related file changes to this branch
  3. Add evidence to the PR (Feat to Milestone) conversation view comments showing the feature being implemented
     - Screenshot(s) of the site view (make sure they clearly show the feature)
     - Screenshot of the database data if applicable
     - Describe each screenshot to specify exactly what's being shown
     - A code snippet screenshot or reference via GitHub markdown may be used as an alternative for evidence that can't be captured on the screen
  4. Update the checklist of the proposal.md file for each feature this is completing (ideally should be 1 branch/pull request per feature, but some cases may have multiple)
    - Basically add an x to the checkbox markdown along with a date after
      - (i.e.,   - [x] (mm/dd/yy) ....) See Template above
    - Add the pull request link as a new indented line for each line item being completed
    - Attach any related issue items on the right-side panel
  5. Merge the Feature Branch into your Milestone branch (this should close the pull request and the attached issues)
    - Merge the Milestone branch into dev, then dev into prod as needed
    - Last two steps are mostly for getting it to prod for delivery of the assignment 
  7. If the attached issues don't close wait until the next step
  8. Merge the updated dev branch into your production branch via a pull request
  9. Close any related issues that didn't auto close
    - You can edit the dropdown on the issue or drag/drop it to the proper column on the project board
